// Description
/*
There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).*/


/* My solution */

function pillars(num_pill, dist, width) {
    // your code here
     
    //check if pillar is 1
    //return 0
    //else multiple thr 
    if(num_pill ==1){
     return 0;
     }
     return ((num_pill-2)*width) + ((100*dist)*(num_pill-1));
  }
